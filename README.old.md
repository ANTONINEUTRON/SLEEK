# SLEEK

A web3 project which will enable writers take full control of their work and keep track of it. 
We intend to facilitate this process by representing the writers work as an NFT. With this in place, the writer can set the access price of their work, know who access it and also eliminate the need of a middle man and in turn ensure the work goes directly from the writer to reader.
